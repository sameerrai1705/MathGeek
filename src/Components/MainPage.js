				This is a mathematics game. If you are a math geek and love to solve puzzles, you have landed
				to the paradise.<br /><hr />
				Two things that will matter most in this game<br />
				1. <b>Speed</b> - More you answer, higher the score.<br/>
				2. <b>Accuracy</b> - Negative score for wrong answers.<br /><br/>

				You have to cross few levels and in each level you will be in front of a really
				simple mathematics/logical question. Write as many solutions within the given
				time limit.<br /><br/>

				You can reach me at <b>sameerrai16050@gmail.com</b>  
				<br /><br/>

				Anyway, <b>Enter your name</b> and get started. May the score be with you :p
